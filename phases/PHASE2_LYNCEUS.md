Phase 2 — Lynceus (Exposure Agent)
Objective

Split exposure into a dedicated agent that joins actor → CVEs → assets (ServiceNow VR, opt-in).

Success Criteria (future)

argo run lynceus --actor FIN7 returns asset counts & examples per CVE.

Works without SNOW (KEV/EPSS-only), enriches when SNOW is configured.

Not started — finish Orpheus first.
